# GNOME-Red-Blue-Desktop
GNOME wallpaper/pattern changer BASH script.



This script provides a way to quickly change your GNOME desktop environment's appearance by setting up keybindings. It allows you to:

- **Change Template (Ctrl+Alt+R):** Switch between red and blue terminal color schemes and wallpaper templates.
- **Change Wallpaper (Ctrl+Alt+T):** Cycle through the wallpapers of the currently active template (red or blue).

The script only works in dark mode, which it sets automatically. It includes six built-in wallpapers: (3 red and 3 blue).


**GNOME version:** GNOME 43.9
